# PILI-PINAS VOTING SYSTEM
A Case Study project conducted during 2024-2025 in my university. This case study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of using blockchain in voting system to
promote transparency and security during election in any form.

## THE SECRET.
I collaborated with my team to conduct various research related to the Election System of the Philippines to simulate the actual process of voting a candidate.
The software was developed in **NETBEANS**, and was presented in class along with the professor and panels. The project was a success, and the professor commended
us for the quality and innovative solution.
